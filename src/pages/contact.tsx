      question:
        "What is Health Coaching and how is it different from nutritionist or dietitian?",
      answer:
        "A Health Coach is the equivalent of who you may want to hire as a sports coach if you were an athlete with a goal to make it to the olympics. What would the coach do? Provide a customized plan for your fitness and keep track of your performance, provide a space to hold you accountable. At the same time, the sports coach will be your sounding board and motivator to continue doing the hard work and reminding you of your goals using the latest research as well as looking at all modalities of therapies. A Health Coach is typically a knowledgeable person in the arena of how our body, mind and spirituality work using science, intuition, experience, listening skills and allowing you to make plans for helping you with making changes in your lifestyle, thinking and overall connection to the world. A nutritionist or a dietitian, on the other hand, is mostly experienced in using food as a way to nourish you and will help you make meal plans while they may or may not be able to provide the connection to other parts of your life.",

      question: "What is the price breakdown of the three coaching programs?",
      answer:
        "What is the price breakdown of the 3 coaching programs\nFor single session coaching, $150/session/60-90 mins\n1 month of coaching with 4 sessions, $400/month or $4400 paid annually to save 1 month of coaching costs and you can choose your coaching months\n3 months with 12 sessions: $80/1 hour session = $960 annual payment\nor $350/month\n6 months 18 sessions $70/session = $1260 single payment \nor $225 per month for 6 months = $1350\nGenerally people like to spread to just 2 sessions a month after the first 3 months, but those who need to continue their weekly support for the next 3 months, you will have the option to extend to weekly sessions every month, so for 6 months, you get 24 sessions, $60 per session = $1440 single payment \nor $260 per month x 6 = $1560",

      question:
        "What is the difference between Nutrition, Nourishment and Fitness?",
      answer:
        "Nutrition is a word that has been used rather as a cliche in the  last decade. However there is way more to it than simply adding some vitamins and isolated minerals to our body. Sometimes we start to even think of our food as micro and macronutrients and make it almost mechanistic as how much of protein, carbs and fat we are supposed to eat. How does it make you feel to eat food this way? Dont you want to enjoy your food without thinking too much about the nutrients? However, you also want your favourite foods to moorish you for energy and not upset your stomach or give you ulcers and headaches or add more weight to your body than you need to. How does it all work? Why do some people eat whatever they want and yet stay slim and energetic while some of us count each calorie and weight each nutrient and yet we add on love handles, swelling in our joints or worse off get acidity or ulcers and headaches? This is where Source Parent Health will help you understand how you are processing foods and also get you back to making choices that give you the flavours you want rather than to satisfy cravings. You will learn what nourishes you truly and how nutrition goes way beyond food, vitamins, supplements, proteins, carbs and fats. ",

      question: "What is Fitness?",
      answer:
        "YOU HAVE HEARD 'SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST', but have you ever pondered on what fitness really means for you? In the wild, which animal survives? The one who can outrun the predator till it cant outrun the predator any more. In fact, sometimes the predator also becomes prey if its not fit. The question to ask is. ARE THESE ANIMALS JUST SURVIVING OR ARE THEY THRIVING? Only the one that is thriving can be fit and so is able to outrun the danger. The animal that is thriving also does not live in fear of another attack. It just goes back to its daily living activities and taking care of itself. Ot eats only what nourishes it and at a time that is nourishing and in portions that it needs. And this animal does not need a health coach. Why?  Because its connected to its Source. It needs no training unlike the animals that live in the zoo or are domesticated. Do you want to survive or thrive? So, let us redefine fitness to thriving and for thriving one needs to be connected to the Source. So that means we need to be less domesticated and more in the flow of how nature designed us. How do we balance this life of living on the cusp of nature and domestication or urbanization? So, to be fit, you need to build some skills to keep you away from fear once the danger is over and to be connected to your source of energy and motivation and love in order to be truly fit and thriving. Welcome to Soucre Parent Health Fitness.",

      question: "What is unique about Source Parent Health Coaching?",
      answer:
        "- The concept of Source Parent Health is that each one of us has a different source for motivation, energy, happiness, etc and we need to be connected to each other in order to be connected to our own Source of what makes us unique. Its not possible for most of us to diagnose where we may be blindsided. Just like an athlete needs a coach and a young driving learner needs a trainer, so also we need a coach who is knowledgeable and has our best interest at hand to guide us to our own center. The second concept of ParenT health is that unless we as parents who are responsible for steering the ship of our young children or the whole family, are vibrating from our core source of energy, we cannot lead the rest of the crew to destination. \n - Sarah is a unique Health Coach, primarily because she has a doctorate in Biochemistry, which makes her very comfortable following the latest scientific research publications and therefore, has the ability to discern between different treatments being used. - Sarah has also studied, practiced on herself and researched ayurveda, Qigong, detox pathways, cooking methods that reduce insulin resistance, aquafitness, yoga, meditation, hypnosis and is a certified laughter yoga instructor \n - Sarah's health coaching focuses on tapping into your own intellect to find the best path to follow for your meals, movement of the body, sleep patterns and train your brain to become laser sharp and in touch with finding your own compass to guide you rather than follow prescriptions and cookie cutter programs. \n- The primary method of coaching at SPH is through one on one as Sarah has discovered it to be the best way where true change happens in the shortest time, as observed in many client testimonials. Most programs are self-paced which leaves a person alone and unaccountable. Its easy to get distracted when nobody is waiting to hear your story.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I do SPH and not some other fancy online program?",
      answer:
        "- Sarah also does not give you any homework to do but takes you on a journey to yourself where you actually get to have fun and get creative and find out your true potential. Once you do that, you naturally start losing weight and make choices that energize you. So there is no program to follow or sites to cheat on. \n - Many of Sarah's clients have reversed diabetes and lost unwanted weight and resolved digestive issues without medications - This is not a diet but a coaching program like a professional athlete would have with his or her coach",

If you are signed up to receive the newsletter, you will be informed of any group coaching programs that will be designed.\n Feel free to contact SPH to ask for specific goal-oriented group sessions.

      question:
        "What do I get in Health Coaching in a month or in group sessions?",
      answer:
        "Quickly get support for any acute issues like digestive upsets, a diagnosis of diabetes or how to get off medications that may be giving you side-effects.  Find your path with more ease and reduce chatter from generic solutions. Build knowledge for the source of your health and the source for your challenges through personal coaching so you too can get on the path of being who you are meant to be. \nBegin your journey to the Source with more confidence and build consistency and relationships to anchor you in your healing without distractions and attend the weekly calls on topics that range from unhealthy weight, fatigue/energy, diabetes, digestion and stress/trauma. \nWhen you do sessions in a group, you get motivated by creating your own circle of influence of 5 people moving forward to become the best versions of themselves. We do get motivated when others around us are also taking action because we become who we hang out with. \nYou could also bring together a group of 5 or more of your friends to create a customized health coaching program to build more consistency and get immense knowledge and proficiency about what makes you YOU and youâ€™re not alone. You also change the lives of 4 others and your circle expands, so you are shifting your circle of influence to the one that makes you shine.

      question: "Why do I need coaching for 3 months?",
      answer:
        "It takes almost 90 days to build a habit. Having a coach by your side has always worked even for those working to get to the olympics. get this deal and test it for yourself and see yourself get things done that you have always imagined. 3 months of coaching with 4 sessions each month will build accountability and train your brain to change your personality to who you truly are and who you really want to be.\nWhen you do one-on-one coaching for 3 months: Now you are building confidence not only in yourself but also in your coach who can be your sounding board, so you start to take risks without fear. You will start building focus, self-esteem, influence and joy and that will become your habit and the new you will emerge because you would have trained this new set of muscle and memory. Your own intellect will become your guide. You will now know how to keep your balance in every situation",
